Ella CMS
========

`Ella`_ is a Content Management System based on `Python`_ web framework `Django`_.
But for starting an application using Ella, only knowledge about adding Python
modules to PYTHONPATH is essential.

It is a set of Django applications designed to work together. Thus, for details
on deployment and configuration please refer to `Django documentation`_.

For creating site using Ella, working knowledge of Django and its templating
language is paramount.
